# Learning Angular

## Getting Started

### Install

First install latest version of NODE.js

Then install angular CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

See commands:

```bash
ng
```

### Create a new boiler plate project

```bash
ng new angular-course
```

Follow the prompts with no for any additional features and select CSS for styling.

Once the project has been generated `cd` into the folder and start it

```bash
cd angular-course
npm start
```

The terminal will output the url for the app you just started.

Ex: `http://localhost:4200/`
